Hi everyone! I am thrilled to announce that I have joined the City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK) as a PhD student in Computer Science. Following my undergraduate studies at Fudan University, my research will now focus on the intersection of Agentic AI and DeFi.

I am eager to explore the potential of autonomous agents in decentralized finance and look forward to collaborating with the brilliant minds here at CityUHK!
